--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
1. At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s): Included alt text for all images across the "Home" page (4 images) and the "About Me" page (11 images)
2. Appropriate headings and paragraph text: utilized a hierachy of <h1> through <h3> as well as <p> tags for descriptions.
3. Links to external page(s): linked the "Resume" button on the Nav bar to an external Google Drive PDF and included a link to the W3C validator in the footer as well.
4. Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them: Implemented two pages with the home page (index.html) and about me page (about-me.html) with navigation done through the nav bar at the top.

(b) CSS features
1. Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability: used CSS box model to create spacing for project-card containers.
2. Leveraging Bootstrap CSS helpers: used rounded-4 for the card shapes and rounding them as well as img-fluid for responsive image scaling.
3. Adding custom font(s) from Google fonts to add more personality: integrated "DM Sans" font from Google Fonts with an @import link with sans-serif fallbacks

(c) Advanced features
1. Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar: created a fixed navigation bar using fixed-top, z-index and padding-top.

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
No, I did not ignore any warnings or errors. But using the checkers did help, as it made me realize a small typo.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
about 12 hours
- 2 hours to draft the portfolio look
- 8 hours on development
- 2 hours to review the assignment/readme/validators
